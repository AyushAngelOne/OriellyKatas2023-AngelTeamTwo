## Social Sharing And Client Metrics

- Sharing trips/reservation details on other social media apps will be handled on the client side.
- We'll integrate with the respective APIs of social media platforms and this will be completely handled on the client side.
- For analytics, we'll store these client-side click events in `Clickstream` database and create a visualisation dashboard out of it to serve various insights to users.
