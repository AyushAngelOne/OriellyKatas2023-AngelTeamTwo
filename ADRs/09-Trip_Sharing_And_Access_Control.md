## Trip Sharing with Targeted People and Access Control

- Users will be able to share their trip info with targeted users using their email/phone.
- We'll create the targeted user profile using the info received from the root user.
- We'll store the sharing details in `Sharing` database which stores the information about all the users with whom the `Trip` is shared.
- Once the targeted user tries to access the trip, they first need to onboard to our platform and finish their onboarding.
- Once the onboarding is complete, they'll be able to view the `Trip` details on the app.
